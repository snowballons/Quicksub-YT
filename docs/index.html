                <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 19, 2024</p>
                <p>Welcome to YT Channel Importer ("the Extension")! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our browser extension and any related services provided by snowballons ("we," "us," or "our"). By installing or using the Extension, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Extension.</p>

                <h4>1. License to Use</h4>
                <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Extension for your personal, non-commercial use, subject to these Terms.</p>
                <p>If you purchase an "Advanced Version" license key, this license extends to the features provided by that version, for use by a single user per key.</p>

                <h4>2. Permitted Use & Restrictions</h4>
                <p>You agree to use the Extension only for its intended purposes, which is to assist in managing and subscribing to YouTube channels from user-provided lists or discovered links.</p>
                <p>You agree not to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the Extension for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
                    <li>Attempt to circumvent any usage limitations or security features of the Extension or YouTube.</li>
                    <li>Violate YouTube's Terms of Service through your use of this Extension. The Extension is a tool, and you are responsible for how you use it in conjunction with YouTube.</li>
                    <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Extension.</li>
                    <li>Distribute, sell (except for official license keys from us), sublicense, or lease the Extension. Sharing of Advanced Version license keys is prohibited.</li>
                    <li>Use the Extension in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair our services (if any backend services are used for key validation) or interfere with any other party's use of the Extension.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We recommend using the Extension responsibly to avoid any negative impact on your YouTube account. Excessive or rapid automated actions can be against YouTube's policies.</p>

                <h4>3. Advanced Version & Payments</h4>
                <p>The Extension offers a free version with certain limitations and an optional paid "Advanced Version" with enhanced features, unlocked via a license key. Payments for license keys are processed through our designated third-party payment processor (Paddle). By making a purchase, you agree to the terms of the payment processor.</p>
                <p>License keys are intended for single-user use and are non-transferable unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>

                <h4>4. Intellectual Property</h4>
                <p>The Extension, including its design, code, and any associated materials (excluding third-party components or YouTube's own platform), are the intellectual property of snowballons and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.</p>

                <h4>5. Disclaimers</h4>

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE EXTENSION WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>
                <p>YOUTUBE'S PLATFORM AND API CAN CHANGE AT ANY TIME. WHILE WE STRIVE TO KEEP THE EXTENSION FUNCTIONAL, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE COMPATIBILITY WITH FUTURE YOUTUBE UPDATES OR THAT ALL FEATURES WILL ALWAYS WORK AS EXPECTED. THE RELIABILITY OF FEATURES LIKE WEBPAGE SCANNING DEPENDS ON THE STRUCTURE OF EXTERNAL WEBSITES, WHICH WE DO NOT CONTROL.</p>

                <h4>6. Limitation of Liability</h4>
                <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, snowballons SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE EXTENSION; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE EXTENSION; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US, IF ANY, FOR THE ADVANCED VERSION LICENSE KEY.</p>

                <h4>7. Changes to Terms</h4>

                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 19, 2024</p>
                <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how YT Channel Importer ("the Extension"), developed by snowballons ("we," "us," or "our"), handles your information.</p>

                <h4>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h4>
                <p>The core functionality of the YT Channel Importer extension is designed to operate locally on your browser. We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any of the following personal information through the extension itself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your YouTube browsing history or watch history.</li>
                    <li>Your YouTube account credentials.</li>
                    <li>The content of the files (CSV, TXT) you upload, beyond local processing within your browser session.</li>
                    <li>The specific URLs of webpages you scan, beyond local processing within your browser session to extract links.</li>
                    <li>The list of YouTube channels you process or subscribe to.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Information Processed Locally</h4>
                <p>The following data is processed and stored locally on your device using browser storage (`chrome.storage.local`) for the Extension's functionality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Usage State:</strong> This includes `linksUsedInSession`, `lastActivityTimestamp`, and `hardCooldownUntil` to manage the free tier usage limits and session resets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Version Activation Key (if purchased):</strong> If you purchase and enter an activation key for the Advanced Version, this key may be stored locally to unlock premium features.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This locally stored data is not transmitted to us or any third parties by the Extension.</p>

                <h4>3. Information Collected During Purchase (via Third-Party Processor)</h4>
                <p>If you choose to purchase an "Advanced Version" license key, the payment process is handled by our third-party payment processor (Paddle). The information you provide during checkout (such as your name, email address, and payment details) is collected and processed by the payment processor according to their own privacy policy. We may receive transactional information from the payment processor (e.g., purchase confirmation, customer email for key delivery) to fulfill your order and provide support.</p>

                <h4>4. Webpage Scanning Feature (`&lt;all_urls&gt;` permission)</h4>
                <p>The "Scan Webpage for Channels" feature requires the `&lt;all_urls&gt;` host permission. This permission is used <strong>solely</strong> to allow the Extension to fetch the HTML content of the webpage URL you explicitly provide in the Extension's popup. The content is fetched and processed locally within your browser (using an offscreen document) to identify potential YouTube channel links. The content of the webpage or the URL itself is not stored by us or transmitted to our servers by the Extension.</p>

                <h4>5. How We Use Information (Related to Purchases/Support)</h4>
                <p>If you purchase an Advanced Version key or contact us for support, we may use your provided email address to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deliver your license key.</li>
                    <li>Respond to your inquiries and provide customer support.</li>
                    <li>Inform you about important updates or issues related to the Extension (with your consent where required).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>6. Data Security</h4>
                <p>We take reasonable measures to protect any information we might handle (e.g., email addresses from purchases or support requests). However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

                <h4>7. Children's Privacy</h4>
                <p>The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

                <h4>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h4>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

                <h4>9. Contact Us</h4>
                <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at snowballons@protonmail.com.</p>

                <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 19, 2024</p>
                <p>Thank you for considering the Advanced Version of YT Channel Importer.</p>

                <h4>1. General Policy</h4>
                <p>Due to the digital nature of the license key provided to unlock the Advanced Version, which grants immediate access to premium features, we generally <strong>do not offer refunds</strong> once a license key has been purchased and delivered.</p>
                <p>We encourage users to utilize the fully functional free version of the Extension to evaluate its core capabilities and ensure it meets their needs before purchasing an Advanced Version license key.</p>

                <h4>2. Exceptional Circumstances</h4>
                <p>We may consider refunds on a case-by-case basis under exceptional circumstances, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the license key provided is non-functional and we are unable to provide a working replacement within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 48-72 business hours) after you have contacted support with details of the issue.</li>
                    <li>Accidental duplicate purchases of the same license key (proof will be required).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To request a refund under such circumstances, please contact us at snowballons@protonmail.com within 14 days of your purchase, providing your order details and a clear explanation of the issue.</p>

                <h4>3. Non-Refundable Circumstances</h4>
                <p>Refunds will generally not be granted for reasons including, but not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changing your mind after purchase.</li>
                    <li>Not needing the Advanced features after purchase.</li>
                    <li>Temporary unavailability of YouTube or changes to YouTube's platform that affect the Extension's functionality (as outlined in our Terms of Service disclaimer).</li>
                    <li>Issues arising from misuse of the Extension or violation of YouTube's Terms of Service.</li>
                    <li>Incompatibility with your browser if your browser does not meet the minimum requirements (though typically Chrome extensions are widely compatible).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Processing Refunds</h4>
                <p>If a refund is approved, it will be processed through our payment processor (Paddle) and returned to your original method of payment. Please note that it may take several business days for the refund to reflect in your account, depending on your bank or card issuer.</p>
                <p>Upon a refund being issued, your Advanced Version license key will be deactivated.</p>

                <h4>5. Contact Us</h4>
                <p>If you have any questions about our Refund Policy, please contact us at snowballons@protonmail.com.</p>
